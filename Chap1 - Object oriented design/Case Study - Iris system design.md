# Iris Classification system design
* We will use [4+1 Views](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4%2B1_architectural_view_model) Model
* Changes to one view will affect all the other views
* The 4 views are described below:
    1. ## Logical View
        * Functionality provided by the system
    2. ## Process View
        * How system processes communicate and how the data is processed
    3. ## Development View
        * How software components are going to be implemented and class definitions
    4. ## Physical View
        * How different components are integrated and deployed
    5. ## Context View
        * External actors or APIs that will interact with the system
* Let's start with context view for a first level understanding
