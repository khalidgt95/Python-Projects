# NamedTuple
* Since indexing in normal tuples can be confusing, we can use NamedTuple
* It works the same as tuple but maps values to variables
* Advantage is that we can add behaviour to the data like normal class

# Dataclasses
* They let us define attributes in a easy-to-use manner
* Acts as a placeholder for a set of related attributes
* We don't need to write a constructor
